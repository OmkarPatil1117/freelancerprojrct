 I have to create 1 different Net art pages that is themed around “unexpected life forms” also known as “aliens”. Would you be able to do this?
It has to be created using the program “Brackets” is that okay?
I can give you some things I would like to see in the three different Net art pages if that would help?
needs to be HTML
 But I would like them to be present in the net art page
I am photoshopping some of the images that were sent to you that I would like to include in the net art pages.
okay I will send them as a PNG file.


So the whole point of the task is to make a web art page that is themed around Unexpected Life forms. It does not need to be a fully functional website.
